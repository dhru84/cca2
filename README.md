# Alpha
Note that this is an early version of this software. If you can see anything that doesn't work as expected, or maybe a way to improve it, please inform me.
As this site is still in developement, it works fine on Chrome web browser, works slow on FF and doesn't work at all at Edge.
These are the known issues.
